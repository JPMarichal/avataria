## Limitations & Considerations

### 1. File Upload Limitations

#### Real File System Testing
**Status:** Not Tested  
**Severity:** Low  
**Impact:** Integration testing required

**Description:**
Unit tests mock file uploads and cannot test actual file system writes, disk space issues, or permission problems.

**Recommendation:**
- Test in actual WordPress environment
- Verify write permissions on wp-content/uploads/
- Test with limited disk space scenarios
- Verify behavior when temp directory is full

#### Large File Uploads
**Status:** Not Tested  
**Severity:** Low  
**Impact:** Performance unknown

**Description:**
Tests validate size limits but don't measure actual upload performance with large files (5-10 MB).

**Recommendation:**
- Performance benchmark with 10 MB files
- Test memory usage with large images
- Verify timeout settings are appropriate
- Monitor server resources during concurrent uploads

### 2. WordPress Compatibility

- Test with media library plugins

### 3. PHP Version Compatibility

#### Multi-Version Testing
**Status:** Partially Tested  
**Severity:** Medium  
**Impact:** PHP 7.4-8.2 compatibility unknown

**Description:**

- Test with PHP 8.2
- Verify no PHP 8.3-specific features used

### 4. Performance

#### Concurrent Upload Testing
**Status:** Not Tested  
**Severity:** Low  
**Impact:** Performance under load unknown

**Description:**
Behavior under concurrent upload scenarios has not been tested.

**Recommendation:**
- Test with 5 simultaneous uploads
- Test with 10 simultaneous uploads
- Test with 50 simultaneous uploads
- Monitor database locks
- Monitor file system contention

#### Database Performance
**Status:** Not Tested  
**Severity:** Low  
**Impact:** Query performance unknown

**Description:**
Database query performance has not been measured in production environment.

**Recommendation:**
- Measure query count per page load

- Check for N+1 query issues
- Profile with WordPress Debug Bar

#### Memory Usage
**Status:** Estimated  
**Severity:** Low  
**Impact:** Real-world usage unknown

**Description:**
Memory usage has only been measured in test environment (8-10 MB).

**Recommendation:**
- Measure memory usage with actual image uploads
- Test with maximum file size uploads
- Monitor memory usage over time
- Verify no memory leaks

### 5. Security

#### Production Environment Testing
**Status:** Not Tested  
**Severity:** Medium  
**Impact:** Real-world security unknown

**Description:**
Security measures have been implemented and tested in unit tests, but not in production environment.

**Recommendation:**
