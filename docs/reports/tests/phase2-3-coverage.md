### Known Issues

1. **WordPress Context Required:**
   - Many tests require WordPress functions (wp_*, add_filter, etc.)
   - Solution: Use WP_UnitTestCase for full integration tests
   - Current: Unit tests validate structure and logic

2. **Database Operations:**
   - Library, Moderation, and other Pro features need DB
   - Solution: Mock or use test database
   - Current: Structure validated, logic tested where possible

3. **HTTP Mocking:**
   - Gravatar blocking tests need HTTP request mocking
   - Social integrations need API mocking
   - Solution: Implement HTTP mocking library
   - Current: Structure and error handling tested
