  - Final approval for next phase

### 2. Edge Case Test Implementation ✅

Implemented 54 new automated edge case tests:

- **UploadServiceEdgeCasesTest** (17 tests)
  - Zero-byte files
  - Size boundary conditions
  - Special characters in filenames
  - Unicode handling
  - Very long filenames
  - Multiple extensions
  - All PHP upload error codes
  - Null and empty values

- **GeneratorEdgeCasesTest** (37 tests)
  - Empty and whitespace strings
  - Single character names
  - Numbers and special characters only
  - Emoji handling
  - Unicode/accented letters
  - Very long names (>100 chars)
  - Multiple/leading/trailing spaces
  - Newlines and tabs
  - Hyphens and apostrophes
  - Multi-part names
  - Mononyms
  - Color generation consistency
  - SQL injection attempts
  - XSS attempts

### 3. Bug Discovery and Fixes ✅

**BUG-001: Array Index Error in Initials Generator**

- **Severity:** Medium
- **Status:** Fixed
- **Component:** Domain/Initials/Generator.php
- **Issue:** Crash when processing names starting with special characters
- **Root Cause:** `array_filter()` preserves keys, leaving array without index 0
- **Fix:** Added `array_values()` to re-index array after filtering
- **Verification:** All 150 tests passing, including new edge case tests
- **Impact:** Improved robustness, better handling of internationalized names

### 4. WordPress Compatibility Validation ✅

Verified compatibility with WordPress standards and requirements:

- ✅ WordPress Coding Standards compliance (phpcs: 5/5 files pass)
- ✅ PHP 7.4+ compatibility (type declarations, modern syntax)
- ✅ WordPress APIs used correctly (Settings API, upload handling)
- ✅ Text domain consistent ('avatar-steward')
- ✅ Namespace correct (AvatarSteward\)
- ✅ Internationalization ready (all strings wrapped)
- ✅ Security best practices followed

### 5. Error Handling Verification ✅

Validated error handling meets requirements:

- ✅ User-friendly error messages
- ✅ No sensitive data exposure
- ✅ Graceful degradation
- ✅ All exceptions caught and handled
- ✅ Proper error codes
- ✅ Clear, actionable feedback

### 6. Performance Validation ✅

Measured and validated performance:

- ✅ Test execution: 140-300ms for 150 tests
- ✅ Memory usage: 8-10 MB (efficient)
- ✅ No memory leaks detected
- ✅ Fast regex operations
- ✅ Efficient array processing
- ✅ Minimal object instantiation
