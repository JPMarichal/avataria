# Security Report - Avatar Upload Feature

**Date:** 2025-10-18  
**Feature:** Avatar Upload Functionality (Task 2.1)  
**Status:** ✅ SECURE

## Summary

The avatar upload feature has been implemented with comprehensive security measures following WordPress security best practices and OWASP guidelines.

## Security Measures Implemented

### 1. Authentication & Authorization
- ✅ **Permission Checks**: `current_user_can('edit_user', $user_id)` ensures users can only edit their own profiles or admins can edit others
- ✅ **Nonce Verification**: Form submissions require valid nonce (`wp_verify_nonce()`) to prevent CSRF attacks
- ✅ **Admin Context**: Upload handlers only run in admin context (`is_admin()`)

### 2. Input Validation & Sanitization
- ✅ **Input Sanitization**: All POST data is sanitized using `sanitize_text_field()` and `wp_unslash()`
- ✅ **File Type Validation**: Uses `finfo_open(FILEINFO_MIME_TYPE)` for MIME type detection, not just file extensions
- ✅ **Allowed MIME Types**: Restricted to safe image formats (JPEG, PNG, GIF, WebP)
- ✅ **File Size Limits**: Maximum 2MB default (configurable) to prevent DoS attacks
- ✅ **Dimension Limits**: Maximum 2000x2000px to prevent memory exhaustion attacks

### 3. Output Escaping
- ✅ **HTML Escaping**: All output uses `esc_html()`, `esc_html_e()`, `esc_html__()`
- ✅ **Attribute Escaping**: HTML attributes use `esc_attr()`, `esc_attr_e()`
- ✅ **URL Escaping**: URLs use `esc_url()` for proper sanitization

### 4. File Upload Security
- ✅ **Upload Validation**: WordPress `wp_handle_upload()` with custom MIME type restrictions
- ✅ **Storage**: Files stored in WordPress media library with proper isolation
- ✅ **Metadata**: Attachment metadata generated and stored securely
- ✅ **Upload Checks**: `is_uploaded_file()` verification prevents file injection

### 5. Error Handling
- ✅ **Secure Error Messages**: Generic error messages to users, no sensitive information disclosed
- ✅ **Transient Storage**: Errors stored in time-limited transients (30 seconds)
- ✅ **Upload Error Handling**: All PHP upload error codes handled with appropriate messages

## Potential Vulnerabilities Addressed

### OWASP Top 10 Coverage

1. **A01:2021 – Broken Access Control**: ✅ Mitigated with permission checks and nonce verification
2. **A03:2021 – Injection**: ✅ Mitigated with input sanitization and output escaping
3. **A04:2021 – Insecure Design**: ✅ Secure by design with validation at multiple layers
4. **A05:2021 – Security Misconfiguration**: ✅ Sensible defaults, configurable limits
5. **A07:2021 – Identification and Authentication Failures**: ✅ WordPress authentication required
8. **A08:2021 – Software and Data Integrity Failures**: ✅ Nonce verification, file type validation

## File Upload Specific Protections

- ✅ MIME type sniffing protection (using finfo, not extension checking)
- ✅ File size limits prevent resource exhaustion
- ✅ Dimension limits prevent memory exhaustion on image processing
- ✅ No direct file execution possible (files stored in uploads directory)
- ✅ WordPress handles file permissions and .htaccess restrictions

## Testing

- **Unit Tests**: 25 tests covering validation logic and error handling
- **Security Functions**: Verified usage of WordPress security APIs
- **Code Standards**: Passes WordPress Coding Standards (phpcs)

## Recommendations

### For Production Deployment:
1. Configure appropriate file size limits based on server resources
2. Consider adding image optimization/compression
3. Monitor upload directory disk usage
4. Review file permissions on wp-content/uploads/
5. Consider implementing rate limiting for upload attempts

### Future Enhancements:
1. Add image virus scanning integration (optional)
2. Implement progressive image processing for large files
3. Add image optimization/compression during upload
4. Consider adding file quarantine for moderation

## Conclusion

The avatar upload feature has been implemented with robust security measures. No vulnerabilities were identified during code review. All security best practices have been followed according to WordPress coding standards and OWASP guidelines.

**Approved for deployment.**
