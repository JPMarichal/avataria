# Phase 2 Bug Fixes - October 2025

## Overview

This document tracks bug fixes and improvements made to the Avatar Steward plugin during the final phase 2 completion period (October 18-20, 2025).

## Issues Resolved

### Issue #64: Avatar Removal Creates Broken Image and Leaves File in Media Library

**Date:** October 18, 2025
**Status:** ✅ Resolved
**Resolution:** GitHub Copilot PR #65 and PR #67

**Problem:**
When users removed their avatar using the "Remove Avatar" button:
- A broken image appeared with URL `http://localhost:8080/wp-admin/2x`
- The avatar file remained in the WordPress Media Library
- No fallback to default avatar occurred

**Root Causes:**
1. Media Library attachment not being deleted when avatar removed
2. Avatar fallback logic not triggering properly
3. WordPress `get_avatar()` generating empty `src` attributes

**Solutions Implemented:**

#### 1. Media Library Cleanup (PR #65)
- Modified `UploadService::delete_avatar()` to properly delete WordPress attachments
- Added `wp_delete_attachment()` call with `true` parameter to force file deletion
- Verified metadata cleanup in database

#### 2. Avatar Fallback Logic (PR #67)
- Enhanced `AvatarHandler::filter_avatar_url()` to return initials-based SVG when no local avatar
- Added proper integration with `Generator` service
- Ensured fallback works across all avatar contexts (profile, comments, admin bar)

#### 3. HTML Filter Fix (Local Implementation - October 19, 2025)
**File:** `src/AvatarSteward/Core/AvatarHandler.php`
**Lines:** 165-202

Even after PR #65 and #67, the broken image persisted because WordPress's `get_avatar()` was generating HTML with empty attributes:
```html
<img src='' srcset=' 2x' />
```

**Solution:** Added `filter_avatar_html()` method to intercept final HTML output:

```php
public function filter_avatar_html( $avatar_html, $id_or_email, $size, $default, $alt, $args ) {
    // Detect empty src attribute
    if ( preg_match( '/src=[\'"][\s]*[\'"]/', $avatar_html ) ) {
        // Get the SVG data URL for this user
        $svg_url = $this->get_initials_avatar_url( $id_or_email, $size );
        
        if ( $svg_url ) {
            // Replace empty src with SVG URL
            $avatar_html = preg_replace(
                '/src=[\'"][\s]*[\'"]/',
                'src=\'' . htmlspecialchars( $svg_url, ENT_QUOTES, 'UTF-8' ) . '\'',
                $avatar_html
            );
            
            // Remove broken srcset attribute
            $avatar_html = preg_replace( '/\s+srcset=[\'"][^\'"]*[\'"]/', '', $avatar_html );
        }
    }
    
    return $avatar_html;
}
```

**Key Implementation Details:**
- Filter registered on `get_avatar` hook with priority 999
- Uses `htmlspecialchars()` instead of `esc_url()` to preserve SVG data URL encoding
- Removes broken `srcset` attributes that cause "2x" URLs
- Maintains compatibility with existing avatar URL filters

**Testing Results:**
- ✅ Avatar removal now shows proper initials-based fallback
- ✅ No broken images in profile, comments, or admin bar
- ✅ Media Library properly cleaned up
- ✅ Database user meta cleared correctly

**Files Modified:**
- `src/AvatarSteward/Core/AvatarHandler.php` - Added `filter_avatar_html()` method and `get_avatar` hook registration

**Documentation:**
- Full technical details in `docs/fixes/avatar-html-filter-fix.md`
- Debug script preserved in `debug-avatar-fallback.php`

### Issue #66: Avatar Default URL Returns Invalid Value

**Date:** October 18, 2025
**Status:** ✅ Resolved (merged with #64 resolution)
**Resolution:** Same as Issue #64 - HTML filter fix

**Problem:**
After avatar removal, the fallback URL was invalid, showing just "2x" in the image source.

**Solution:**
Resolved by implementing the comprehensive HTML filter approach described above. The issue was not with the URL filtering itself (which was working correctly) but with how WordPress generated the final HTML.

## UI Improvements

### Profile Section Title Update

**Date:** October 19, 2025
**File:** `src/AvatarSteward/Domain/Uploads/ProfileFieldsRenderer.php`
**Line:** 149

Changed the profile section title from "Avatar" to "Avatar Steward" for better plugin branding and user recognition.

**Before:**
```php
<h2><?php esc_html_e( 'Avatar', 'avatar-steward' ); ?></h2>
```

**After:**
```php
<h2><?php esc_html_e( 'Avatar Steward', 'avatar-steward' ); ?></h2>
```

**Impact:**
- Better brand visibility in user profiles
- Clearer indication that Avatar Steward is managing the avatar
- Consistent with plugin naming conventions

## Lessons Learned

### WordPress Avatar System Architecture

The WordPress avatar system has multiple layers:

1. **Data Layer:** `pre_get_avatar_data` filter - Returns avatar data array
2. **URL Layer:** `get_avatar_url` filter - Returns the image URL
3. **HTML Layer:** `get_avatar` filter - Returns final HTML output

**Critical Discovery:** Filtering URLs alone is insufficient. WordPress's `get_avatar()` function can generate HTML with empty `src` attributes even when URL filters return valid values. This happens when:
- `get_avatar_url()` is called multiple times (normal + 2x for retina)
- The second call (for srcset) fails or returns empty
- WordPress concatenates the results improperly

**Solution:** Always implement HTML-level filtering as a final safety net, even if URL filtering appears to work correctly.

### SVG Data URLs in HTML Attributes

When inserting SVG data URLs into HTML attributes:
- Use `htmlspecialchars()` to preserve URL encoding
- Do NOT use `esc_url()` as it can break the data URI structure
- Always set `ENT_QUOTES` flag to escape both single and double quotes

### Testing Avatar Fallbacks

To properly test avatar fallback scenarios:
1. Test URL filters individually
2. Test data filters individually  
3. Test final HTML output (most critical)
4. Test in all contexts: profile page, comments, admin bar, author listings
5. Use debug scripts that output all three filter results

## Verification Commands

```bash
# Run debug script to verify all filters working
php debug-avatar-fallback.php

# Check linting compliance
composer lint

# Run PHPUnit tests
composer test

# Verify git status
git status
```
