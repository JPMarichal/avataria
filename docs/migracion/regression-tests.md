### Test Data Setup

Create the following test scenarios:

1. **Users with Simple Local Avatars**
   - User: `test_simple_1` with `simple_local_avatar` meta set
   - User: `test_simple_2` with `simple_local_avatar` meta set
   - User: `test_simple_3` without any avatar meta

2. **Users with WP User Avatar**
   - User: `test_wpuser_1` with `wp_user_avatar` meta set
   - User: `test_wpuser_2` with `wp_user_avatar` meta set
   - User: `test_wpuser_3` without any avatar meta

3. **Users with Gravatars**
   - User: `test_gravatar_1@example.com` with active Gravatar
   - User: `test_gravatar_2@example.com` with active Gravatar

## Automated Test Results

Current automated test results:

```
PHPUnit 9.6.29
Tests: 116, Assertions: 236
OK (116 tests, 236 assertions)
```

Migration-specific tests:
- `tests/phpunit/Domain/Migration/MigrationServiceTest.php`: 9 tests, 21 assertions

## Known Issues and Limitations

Document any known issues:

1. **Large Gravatar Imports**
   - May timeout on sites with 1000+ users
   - Workaround: Use WP-CLI or increase timeout

2. **Network Dependencies**
   - Gravatar import requires outbound HTTPS
   - May fail behind restrictive firewalls

3. **Memory Usage**
   - Processing many large images may consume memory
   - Configure PHP memory_limit appropriately

## Future Test Enhancements

Planned improvements:

1. Integration tests with WordPress test suite
2. Automated UI testing with Playwright/Selenium
3. Load testing for large user bases
4. Continuous integration with GitHub Actions
5. Code coverage reports for migration code

## Support and Debugging

If regression tests fail:

1. Review WordPress debug.log
2. Check PHP error logs
3. Verify test preconditions
4. Compare with documented expected results
5. Check for plugin conflicts
6. Document unexpected behavior
7. Report issues with test results attached
